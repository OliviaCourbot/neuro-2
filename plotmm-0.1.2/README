The PlotMM Widget Library
-------------------------

      PlotMM is an extension to the gtkmm library.  It contains widgets
      which are primarily useful for technical and scientifical purposes.
      Initially, this is a 2-D plotting widget.

      PlotMM is based in part on the work of the Qwt project 
      (http://qwt.sf.net).

      PlotMM is hosted at http://plotmm.sf.net/
